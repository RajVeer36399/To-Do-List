# To-Do-List

Developed a basic To-Do List application with a clean and user-friendly interface. Implemented functionality
to add, edit, and delete tasks. Incorporated JavaScript to handle task completion toggles, allowing users to
mark tasks as complete or incomplete. Enhanced user experience with features such as persistency using
local storage to save and retrieve tasks, ensuring tasks remain even after page reloads or browser closure.

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
